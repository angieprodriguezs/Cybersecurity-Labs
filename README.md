# Cybersecurity Labs Portfolio

This repository contains three Windows security labs demonstrating practical skills in malware removal, auditing for compliance, and system hardening. These labs were completed as part of my cybersecurity training and highlight my ability to detect threats, assess system security, and implement best practices.

## Labs
